wonderland alice s adventures in wonderland lewis carroll the millennium fulcrum edition 3 chapter i sent_end', 'sent_start down the rabbit alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or conversations so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisy would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her sent_end', 'sent_start there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear sent_end', 'sent_start oh dear sent_end', 'sent_start i shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit under the hedge sent_end', 'sent_start in another moment down went alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again sent_end', 'sent_start the rabbit went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well sent_end', 'sent_start either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next sent_end', 'sent_start first she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs sent_end', 'sent_start she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it sent_end', 'sent_start well thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs sent_end', 'sent_start how brave they ll all think me at home sent_end', 'sent_start why i wouldn t say anything about it even if i fell off the top of the house which was very likely true sent_end', 'sent_start down down down sent_end', 'sent_start would the fall never come to an end sent_end', 'sent_start i wonder how many miles i ve fallen by this time she said aloud sent_end', 'sent_start i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth sent_end', 'sent_start let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over yes that s about the right distance but then i wonder what latitude or longitude i ve got to alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say sent_end', 'sent_start presently she began again sent_end', 'sent_start i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth sent_end', 'sent_start how funny it ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward sent_end', 'sent_start the antipathies i think she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didn t sound at all the right word but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know sent_end', 'sent_start please ma am is this new zealand or australia and she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy curtseying as you re falling through the air sent_end', 'sent_start do you think you could manage it sent_end', 'sent_start and what an ignorant little girl she ll think me for asking sent_end', 'sent_start no it ll never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere down down down sent_end', 'sent_start there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again sent_end', 'sent_start dinah ll miss me very much to i should think dinah was the cat sent_end', 'sent_start i hope they ll remember her saucer of milk at tea sent_end', 'sent_start dinah my dear sent_end', 'sent_start i wish you were down here with me sent_end', 'sent_start there are no mice in the air i m afraid but you might catch a bat and that s very like a mouse you know sent_end', 'sent_start but do cats eat bats i wonder and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way do cats eat bats sent_end', 'sent_start do cats eat bats and sometimes do bats eat cats for you see as she couldn t answer either question it didn t much matter which way she put it sent_end', 'sent_start she felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her very earnestly now dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat when suddenly thump sent_end', 'sent_start thump sent_end', 'sent_start down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over sent_end', 'sent_start alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it sent_end', 'sent_start there was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late it s getting she was close behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof sent_end', 'sent_start there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again sent_end', 'sent_start suddenly she came upon a little three table all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and alice s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas sent_end', 'sent_start either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them sent_end', 'sent_start however on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted sent_end', 'sent_start alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rat she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw sent_end', 'sent_start how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor alice it would be of very little use without my shoulders sent_end', 'sent_start oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescope sent_end', 'sent_start i think i could if i only knew how to begin for you see so many out things had happened lately that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible sent_end', 'sent_start there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not here before said alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters sent_end', 'sent_start it was all very well to say drink me but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry sent_end', 'sent_start no i ll look first she said and see whether it s marked poison or not for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a red poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later sent_end', 'sent_start however this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of cherry custard pine roast turkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off sent_end', 'sent_start what a curious feeling said alice i must be shutting up like a telescope and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden sent_end', 'sent_start first however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know said alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle sent_end', 'sent_start i wonder what i should be like then and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing sent_end', 'sent_start after a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice sent_end', 'sent_start when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried sent_end', 'sent_start come there s no use in crying like that said alice to herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people sent_end', 'sent_start but it s no use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people sent_end', 'sent_start why there s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currants sent_end', 'sent_start well i ll eat it said alice and if it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either way i ll get into the garden and i don t care which happens she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which way sent_end', 'sent_start which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way sent_end', 'sent_start so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake sent_end', 'sent_start chapter ii sent_end', 'sent_start the pool of tears curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now i m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was sent_end', 'sent_start good feet for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off sent_end', 'sent_start oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears sent_end', 'sent_start i m sure shan t be able sent_end', 'sent_start i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you can but i must be kind to them thought alice or perhaps they won t walk the way i want to go sent_end', 'sent_start let me see i ll give them a new pair of boots every christmas and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it sent_end', 'sent_start they must go by the carrier she thought and how funny it ll seem sending presents to one s own feet sent_end', 'sent_start and how odd the directions will look sent_end', 'sent_start alice s right foot esq sent_end', 'sent_start hearthrug near the fender with alice s love sent_end', 'sent_start oh dear what nonsense i m talking just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door sent_end', 'sent_start poor alice sent_end', 'sent_start it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again sent_end', 'sent_start you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way sent_end', 'sent_start stop this moment i tell you but she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall sent_end', 'sent_start after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming sent_end', 'sent_start it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh sent_end', 'sent_start the duchess the duchess sent_end', 'sent_start oh sent_end', 'sent_start won t she be savage if i ve kept her waiting alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice if you please sir the rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go sent_end', 'sent_start alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear sent_end', 'sent_start how queer everything is to sent_end', 'sent_start and yesterday things went on just as usual sent_end', 'sent_start i wonder if i ve been changed in the night sent_end', 'sent_start let me think was i the same when i got up this morning sent_end', 'sent_start i almost think i can remember feeling a little different sent_end', 'sent_start but if i m not the same the next question is who in the world am i sent_end', 'sent_start ah that s the great puzzle and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them sent_end', 'sent_start i m sure i m not ada she said for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesn t go in ringlets at all and i m sure i can t be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she oh sent_end', 'sent_start she knows such a very little sent_end', 'sent_start besides she s she and i m i and oh dear how puzzling it all is sent_end', 'sent_start i ll try if i know all the things i used to know sent_end', 'sent_start let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven is oh dear sent_end', 'sent_start i shall never get to twenty at that rate sent_end', 'sent_start however the multiplication table doesn t signify let s try geography sent_end', 'sent_start london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome and rome no that s all wrong i m certain sent_end', 'sent_start i must have been changed for mabel sent_end', 'sent_start i ll try and say how doth the little and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail and pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale sent_end', 'sent_start how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws i m sure those are not the right words said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on i must be mabel after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh sent_end', 'sent_start ever so many lessons to learn sent_end', 'sent_start no i ve made up my mind about it if i m mabel i ll stay down here sent_end', 'sent_start it ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again dear i shall only look up and say who am i then sent_end', 'sent_start tell me that first and then if i like being that person i ll come up if not i ll stay down here till i m somebody else but oh dear cried alice with a sudden burst of tears i do wish they would put their heads down sent_end', 'sent_start i am so very tired of being all alone here as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit s little white kid gloves while she was talking sent_end', 'sent_start how can i have done that she thought sent_end', 'sent_start i must be growing small again she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether sent_end', 'sent_start that was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas sent_end', 'sent_start the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child for i never was so small as this before never sent_end', 'sent_start and i declare it s too bad that it is as she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash sent_end', 'sent_start she was up to her chin in salt water sent_end', 'sent_start her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case i can go back by railway she said to herself sent_end', 'sent_start alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station sent_end', 'sent_start however she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high sent_end', 'sent_start i wish i hadn t cried so much said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out sent_end', 'sent_start i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears sent_end', 'sent_start that will be a queer thing to be sure sent_end', 'sent_start however everything is queer to just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself sent_end', 'sent_start would it be of any use now thought alice to speak to this mouse sent_end', 'sent_start everything is so out down here that i should think very likely it can talk at any rate there s no harm in trying so she began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool sent_end', 'sent_start i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her brother s latin grammar a mouse of a mouse to a mouse a mouse o mouse the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing sent_end', 'sent_start perhaps it doesn t understand english thought alice i daresay it s a french mouse come over with william the conqueror for with all her knowledge of history alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened sent_end', 'sent_start so she began again ou est ma chatte which was the first sentence in her french lesson sent_end', 'sent_start the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright sent_end', 'sent_start oh i beg your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animal s feelings sent_end', 'sent_start i quite forgot you didn t like cats not like cats cried the mouse in a shrill passionate voice sent_end', 'sent_start would you like cats if you were me well perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone don t be angry about it sent_end', 'sent_start and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think you d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her sent_end', 'sent_start she is such a dear quiet thing alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her face and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse and she s such a capital one for catching mice oh i beg your pardon cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended sent_end', 'sent_start we won t talk about her any more if you d rather not we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of his tail sent_end', 'sent_start as if i would talk on such a subject sent_end', 'sent_start our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things sent_end', 'sent_start don t let me hear the name again i won t indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation sent_end', 'sent_start are you are you fond of of dogs the mouse did not answer so alice went on eagerly there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you sent_end', 'sent_start a little bright terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair sent_end', 'sent_start and it ll fetch things when you throw them and it ll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of things i can t remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer you know and he says it s so useful it s worth a hundred pounds sent_end', 'sent_start he says it kills all the rats and oh dear cried alice in a sorrowful tone i m afraid i ve offended it again for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went sent_end', 'sent_start so she called softly after it mouse dear sent_end', 'sent_start do come back again and we won t talk about cats or dogs either if you don t like them when the mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale with passion alice thought and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to the shore and then i ll tell you my history and you ll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures sent_end', 'sent_start alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore sent_end', 'sent_start chapter iii sent_end', 'sent_start a caucus and a long tale they were indeed a queer party that assembled on the bank the birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable sent_end', 'sent_start the first question of course was how to get dry again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life sent_end', 'sent_start indeed she had quite a long argument with the lory who at last turned sulky and would only say i am older than you and must know better and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was and as the lory positively refused to tell its age there was no more to be said sent_end', 'sent_start at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out sit down all of you and listen to me sent_end', 'sent_start i ll soon make you dry enough they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse in the middle sent_end', 'sent_start alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon sent_end', 'sent_start ahem said the mouse with an important air are you all ready sent_end', 'sent_start this is the driest thing i know sent_end', 'sent_start silence all round if you please sent_end', 'sent_start william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest sent_end', 'sent_start edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria ugh said the lory with a shiver sent_end', 'sent_start i beg your pardon said the mouse frowning but very politely did you speak not i said the lory hastily sent_end', 'sent_start i thought you did said the mouse sent_end', 'sent_start i proceed sent_end', 'sent_start edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria declared for him and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of canterbury found it advisable found what said the duck sent_end', 'sent_start found it the mouse replied rather crossly of course you know what it means i know what it means well enough when i find a thing said the duck it s generally a frog or a worm sent_end', 'sent_start the question is what did the archbishop find the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown sent_end', 'sent_start william s conduct at first was moderate sent_end', 'sent_start but the insolence of his normans how are you getting on now my dear it continued turning to alice as it spoke sent_end', 'sent_start as wet as ever said alice in a melancholy tone it doesn t seem to dry me at all in that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies speak english said the eaglet sent_end', 'sent_start i don t know the meaning of half those long words and what s more i don t believe you do either and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds tittered audibly sent_end', 'sent_start what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone was that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus what is a caucus said alice not that she wanted much to know but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything sent_end', 'sent_start why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it and as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day i will tell you how the dodo managed it sent_end', 'sent_start first it marked out a race in a sort of circle the exact shape doesn t matter it said and then all the party were placed along the course here and there sent_end', 'sent_start there was no one two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over sent_end', 'sent_start however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called out the race is over and they all crowded round it panting and asking but who has won this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead the position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence sent_end', 'sent_start at last the dodo said everybody has won and all must have prizes but who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked sent_end', 'sent_start why she of course said the dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way prizes sent_end', 'sent_start prizes alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes sent_end', 'sent_start there was exactly one a all round sent_end', 'sent_start but she must have a prize herself you know said the mouse sent_end', 'sent_start of course the dodo replied very gravely sent_end', 'sent_start what else have you got in your pocket he went on turning to alice sent_end', 'sent_start only a thimble said alice sadly sent_end', 'sent_start hand it over here said the dodo sent_end', 'sent_start then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered sent_end', 'sent_start alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she could sent_end', 'sent_start the next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back sent_end', 'sent_start however it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more sent_end', 'sent_start you promised to tell me your history you know said alice and why it is you hate c and d she added in a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again sent_end', 'sent_start mine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse turning to alice and sighing sent_end', 'sent_start it is a long tail certainly said alice looking down with wonder at the mouse s tail but why do you call it sad and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like this fury said to a mouse that he met in the house let us both go to law i will prosecute you come i ll take no denial we must have a trial for really this morning i ve nothing to do said the mouse to the cur such a trial dear sir with no jury or judge would be wasting our breath i ll be judge i ll be jury said cunning old fury i ll try the whole cause and condemn you to death you are not attending said the mouse to alice severely sent_end', 'sent_start what are you thinking of i beg your pardon said alice very humbly you had got to the fifth bend i think i had not cried the mouse sharply and very angrily sent_end', 'sent_start a knot said alice always ready to make herself useful and looking anxiously about her sent_end', 'sent_start oh do let me help to undo it i shall do nothing of the sort said the mouse getting up and walking away sent_end', 'sent_start you insult me by talking such nonsense i didn t mean it pleaded poor alice sent_end', 'sent_start but you re so easily offended you know the mouse only growled in reply sent_end', 'sent_start please come back and finish your story alice called after it and the others all joined in chorus yes please do but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker sent_end', 'sent_start what a pity it wouldn t stay sighed the lory as soon as it was quite out of sight and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter ah my dear sent_end', 'sent_start let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper hold your tongue ma said the young crab a little snappishly sent_end', 'sent_start you re enough to try the patience of an oyster i wish i had our dinah here i know i do said alice aloud addressing nobody in particular sent_end', 'sent_start she d soon fetch it back and who is dinah if i might venture to ask the question said the lory sent_end', 'sent_start alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet dinah s our cat sent_end', 'sent_start and she s such a capital one for catching mice you can t think sent_end', 'sent_start and oh i wish you could see her after the birds sent_end', 'sent_start why she ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party sent_end', 'sent_start some of the birds hurried off at once one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking i really must be getting home the night doesn t suit my throat and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my dears sent_end', 'sent_start it s high time you were all in bed on various pretexts they all moved off and alice was soon left alone sent_end', 'sent_start i wish i hadn t mentioned dinah she said to herself in a melancholy tone sent_end', 'sent_start nobody seems to like her down here and i m sure she s the best cat in the world sent_end', 'sent_start oh my dear dinah sent_end', 'sent_start i wonder if i shall ever see you any more and here poor alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and low sent_end', 'sent_start in a little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to finish his story sent_end', 'sent_start chapter iv sent_end', 'sent_start the rabbit sends in a little bill it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself the duchess sent_end', 'sent_start the duchess sent_end', 'sent_start oh my dear paws sent_end', 'sent_start oh my fur and whiskers sent_end', 'sent_start she ll get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets sent_end', 'sent_start where can i have dropped them i wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she very good began hunting about for them but they were nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished completely sent_end', 'sent_start very soon the rabbit noticed alice as she went hunting about and called out to her in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing out here sent_end', 'sent_start run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan sent_end', 'sent_start quick now and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had made sent_end', 'sent_start he took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran sent_end', 'sent_start how surprised he ll be when he finds out who i am sent_end', 'sent_start but i d better take him his fan and gloves that is if i can find them as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name w sent_end', 'sent_start rabbit engraved upon it sent_end', 'sent_start she went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves sent_end', 'sent_start how queer it seems alice said to herself to be going messages for a rabbit sent_end', 'sent_start i suppose dinah ll be sending me on messages next and she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen miss alice sent_end', 'sent_start come here directly and get ready for your walk coming in a minute nurse sent_end', 'sent_start but i ve got to see that the mouse doesn t get out only i don t think alice went on that they d let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking sent_end', 'sent_start there was no label this time with the words drink me but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips sent_end', 'sent_start i know something interesting is sure to happen she said to herself whenever i eat or drink anything so i ll just see what this bottle does sent_end', 'sent_start i do hope it ll make me grow large again for really i m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing it did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken sent_end', 'sent_start she hastily put down the bottle saying to herself that s quite enough i hope i shan t grow any more as it is i can t get out at the door i do wish i hadn t drunk quite so much alas sent_end', 'sent_start it was too late to wish that sent_end', 'sent_start she went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head sent_end', 'sent_start still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more whatever happens sent_end', 'sent_start what will become of me luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy sent_end', 'sent_start it was much pleasanter at home thought poor alice when one wasn t always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits sent_end', 'sent_start i almost wish i hadn t gone down that rabbit and yet and yet it s rather curious you know this sort of life sent_end', 'sent_start i do wonder what can have happened to me sent_end', 'sent_start when i used to read fairy i fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here i am in the middle of one sent_end', 'sent_start there ought to be a book written about me that there ought sent_end', 'sent_start and when i grow up i ll write one but i m grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone at least there s no room to grow up any more here but then thought alice shall i never get any older than i am now sent_end', 'sent_start that ll be a comfort one way never to be an old woman but then always to have lessons to learn sent_end', 'sent_start oh i shouldn t like that oh you foolish alice she answered herself sent_end', 'sent_start how can you learn lessons in here sent_end', 'sent_start why there s hardly room for you and no room at all for any lesson and so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen sent_end', 'sent_start mary ann sent_end', 'sent_start mary ann said the voice sent_end', 'sent_start fetch me my gloves this moment then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs sent_end', 'sent_start alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it sent_end', 'sent_start presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened inwards and alice s elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved a failure sent_end', 'sent_start alice heard it say to itself then i ll go round and get in at the window that you won t thought alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air sent_end', 'sent_start she did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber or something of the sort sent_end', 'sent_start next came an angry voice the rabbit s pat sent_end', 'sent_start pat sent_end', 'sent_start where are you and then a voice she had never heard before sure then i m here sent_end', 'sent_start digging for apples yer honour digging for apples indeed said the rabbit angrily sent_end', 'sent_start here sent_end', 'sent_start come and help me out of this sounds of more broken glass sent_end', 'sent_start now tell me pat what s that in the window sure it s an arm yer honour he pronounced it arrum an arm you goose sent_end', 'sent_start who ever saw one that size sent_end', 'sent_start why it fills the whole window sure it does yer honour but it s an arm for all that well it s got no business there at any rate go and take it away there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers now and then such as sure i don t like it yer honour at all at all do as i tell you you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air sent_end', 'sent_start this time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass sent_end', 'sent_start what a number of cucumber there must be thought alice sent_end', 'sent_start i wonder what they ll do next sent_end', 'sent_start as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could sent_end', 'sent_start i m sure i don t want to stay in here any longer she waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words where s the other ladder why i hadn t to bring but one bill s got the other bill sent_end', 'sent_start fetch it here lad here put em up at this corner no tie em together first they don t reach half high enough yet oh sent_end', 'sent_start they ll do well enough don t be particular here bill sent_end', 'sent_start catch hold of this rope will the roof bear mind that loose slate oh it s coming down sent_end', 'sent_start heads below a loud crash now who did that it was bill i fancy who s to go down the chimney nay i shan t sent_end', 'sent_start you do it that i won t then bill s to go down here bill sent_end', 'sent_start the master says you re to go down the chimney oh sent_end', 'sent_start so bill s got to come down the chimney has he said alice to herself sent_end', 'sent_start shy they seem to put everything upon bill sent_end', 'sent_start i wouldn t be in bill s place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but i think i can kick a little she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal she couldn t guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself this is bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next sent_end', 'sent_start the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes bill then the rabbit s voice along catch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices hold up his head brandy now don t choke him how was it old fellow sent_end', 'sent_start what happened to you sent_end', 'sent_start tell us all about it last came a little feeble squeaking voice that s bill thought alice well i hardly know no more thank ye i m better now but i m a deal too flustered to tell you all i know is something comes at me like a jack and up i goes like a sky so you did old fellow said the others sent_end', 'sent_start we must burn the house down said the rabbit s voice and alice called out as loud as she could if you do sent_end', 'sent_start i ll set dinah at you there was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to herself i wonder what they will do next sent_end', 'sent_start if they had any sense they d take the roof off after a minute or two they began moving about again and alice heard the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin with a barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face sent_end', 'sent_start i ll put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out you d better not do that again which produced another dead silence sent_end', 'sent_start alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head sent_end', 'sent_start if i eat one of these cakes she thought it s sure to make some change in my size and as it can t possibly make me larger it must make me smaller i suppose so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly sent_end', 'sent_start as soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside sent_end', 'sent_start the poor little lizard bill was in the middle being held up by two guinea who were giving it something out of a bottle sent_end', 'sent_start they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood sent_end', 'sent_start the first thing i ve got to do said alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden sent_end', 'sent_start i think that will be the best plan it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry sent_end', 'sent_start an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her sent_end', 'sent_start poor little thing said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing sent_end', 'sent_start hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut sent_end', 'sent_start this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppy s bark sounded quite faint in the distance sent_end', 'sent_start and yet what a dear little puppy it was said alice as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves i should have liked teaching it tricks very much if if i d only been the right size to do it sent_end', 'sent_start oh dear sent_end', 'sent_start i d nearly forgotten that i ve got to grow up again sent_end', 'sent_start let me see how is it to be managed sent_end', 'sent_start i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is what the great question certainly was what sent_end', 'sent_start alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances sent_end', 'sent_start there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it sent_end', 'sent_start she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else sent_end', 'sent_start chapter v advice from a caterpillar the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice sent_end', 'sent_start who are you said the caterpillar sent_end', 'sent_start this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation sent_end', 'sent_start alice replied rather shyly i i hardly know sir just at present at least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have been changed several times since then what do you mean by that said the caterpillar sternly sent_end', 'sent_start explain yourself i can t explain myself i m afraid sir said alice because i m not myself you see i don t see said the caterpillar sent_end', 'sent_start i m afraid i can t put it more clearly alice replied very politely for i can t understand it myself to begin with and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing it isn t said the caterpillar sent_end', 'sent_start well perhaps you haven t found it so yet said alice but when you have to turn into a chrysalis you will some day you know and then after that into a butterfly i should think you ll feel it a little queer won t you not a bit said the caterpillar sent_end', 'sent_start well perhaps your feelings may be different said alice all i know is it would feel very queer to me you said the caterpillar contemptuously sent_end', 'sent_start who are you which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation sent_end', 'sent_start alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar s making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell me who you are first why said the caterpillar sent_end', 'sent_start here was another puzzling question and as alice could not think of any good reason and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind she turned away sent_end', 'sent_start come back the caterpillar called after her sent_end', 'sent_start i ve something important to say this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back again sent_end', 'sent_start keep your temper said the caterpillar sent_end', 'sent_start is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she could sent_end', 'sent_start no said the caterpillar sent_end', 'sent_start alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing sent_end', 'sent_start for some minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said so you think you re changed do you i m afraid i am sir said alice i can t remember things as i used and i don t keep the same size for ten minutes together can t remember what things said the caterpillar sent_end', 'sent_start well i ve tried to say how doth the little busy bee but it all came different alice replied in a very melancholy voice sent_end', 'sent_start repeat you are old father william said the caterpillar sent_end', 'sent_start alice folded her hands and began you are old father william the young man said and your hair has become very white and yet you incessantly stand on your head do you think at your age it is right in my youth father william replied to his son i feared it might injure the brain but now that i m perfectly sure i have none why i do it again and again you are old said the youth as i mentioned before and have grown most uncommonly fat yet you turned a back in at the door pray what is the reason of that in my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointment one shilling the box allow me to sell you a couple you are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak pray how did you manage to do it in my youth said his father i took to the law and argued each case with my wife and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw has lasted the rest of my life you are old said the youth one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose what made you so awfully clever i have answered three questions and that is enough said his father don t give yourself airs sent_end', 'sent_start do you think i can listen all day to such stuff sent_end', 'sent_start be off or i ll kick you down stairs that is not said right said the caterpillar sent_end', 'sent_start not quite right i m afraid said alice timidly some of the words have got altered it is wrong from beginning to end said the caterpillar decidedly and there was silence for some minutes sent_end', 'sent_start the caterpillar was the first to speak sent_end', 'sent_start what size do you want to be it asked sent_end', 'sent_start oh i m not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one doesn t like changing so often you know i don t know said the caterpillar sent_end', 'sent_start alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper sent_end', 'sent_start are you content now said the caterpillar sent_end', 'sent_start well i should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldn t mind said alice three inches is such a wretched height to be it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high sent_end', 'sent_start but i m not used to it pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone sent_end', 'sent_start and she thought of herself i wish the creatures wouldn t be so easily offended you ll get used to it in time said the caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again sent_end', 'sent_start this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again sent_end', 'sent_start in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself sent_end', 'sent_start then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter one side of what sent_end', 'sent_start the other side of what thought alice to herself sent_end', 'sent_start of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight sent_end', 'sent_start alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question sent_end', 'sent_start however at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand sent_end', 'sent_start and now which is which she said to herself and nibbled a little of the right bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot sent_end', 'sent_start she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit sent_end', 'sent_start her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit sent_end', 'sent_start come my head s free at last said alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her sent_end', 'sent_start what can all that green stuff be said alice sent_end', 'sent_start and where have my shoulders got to sent_end', 'sent_start and oh my poor hands how is it i can t see you she was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves sent_end', 'sent_start as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent sent_end', 'sent_start she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings sent_end', 'sent_start serpent screamed the pigeon sent_end', 'sent_start i m not a serpent said alice indignantly sent_end', 'sent_start let me alone serpent i say again repeated the pigeon but in a more subdued tone and added with a kind of sob i ve tried every way and nothing seems to suit them i haven t the least idea what you re talking about said alice sent_end', 'sent_start i ve tried the roots of trees and i ve tried banks and i ve tried hedges the pigeon went on without attending to her but those serpents sent_end', 'sent_start there s no pleasing them alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished sent_end', 'sent_start as if it wasn t trouble enough hatching the eggs said the pigeon but i must be on the look for serpents night and day sent_end', 'sent_start why i haven t had a wink of sleep these three weeks i m very sorry you ve been annoyed said alice who was beginning to see its meaning sent_end', 'sent_start and just as i d taken the highest tree in the wood continued the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky sent_end', 'sent_start ugh serpent but i m not a serpent i tell you said alice sent_end', 'sent_start i m a i m a well sent_end', 'sent_start what are you said the pigeon sent_end', 'sent_start i can see you re trying to invent something i i m a little girl said alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day sent_end', 'sent_start a likely story indeed said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt sent_end', 'sent_start i ve seen a good many little girls in my time but never one with such a neck as that sent_end', 'sent_start no no sent_end', 'sent_start you re a serpent and there s no use denying it sent_end', 'sent_start i suppose you ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg i have tasted eggs certainly said alice who was a very truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you know i don t believe it said the pigeon but if they do why then they re a kind of serpent that s all i can say this was such a new idea to alice that she was quite silent for a minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding you re looking for eggs i know that well enough and what does it matter to me whether you re a little girl or a serpent it matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but i m not looking for eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldn t want yours i don t like them raw well be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again into its nest sent_end', 'sent_start alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it sent_end', 'sent_start after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height sent_end', 'sent_start it was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual sent_end', 'sent_start come there s half my plan done now sent_end', 'sent_start how puzzling all these changes are sent_end', 'sent_start i m never sure what i m going to be from one minute to another sent_end', 'sent_start however i ve got back to my right size the next thing is to get into that beautiful garden how is that to be done i wonder as she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high sent_end', 'sent_start whoever lives there thought alice it ll never do to come upon them this size why i should frighten them out of their wits so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high sent_end', 'sent_start chapter vi sent_end', 'sent_start pig and pepper for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fish and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles sent_end', 'sent_start it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their heads sent_end', 'sent_start she felt very curious to know what it was all about and crept a little way out of the wood to listen sent_end', 'sent_start the fish began by producing from under his arm a great letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone for the duchess sent_end', 'sent_start an invitation from the queen to play croquet the frog repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the words a little from the queen sent_end', 'sent_start an invitation for the duchess to play croquet then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together sent_end', 'sent_start alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the fish was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky sent_end', 'sent_start alice went timidly up to the door and knocked sent_end', 'sent_start there s no sort of use in knocking said the footman and that for two reasons sent_end', 'sent_start first because i m on the same side of the door as you are secondly because they re making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear you and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within a constant howling and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces sent_end', 'sent_start please then said alice how am i to get in there might be some sense in your knocking the footman went on without attending to her if we had the door between us sent_end', 'sent_start for instance if you were inside you might knock and i could let you out you know he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this alice thought decidedly uncivil sent_end', 'sent_start but perhaps he can t help it she said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head sent_end', 'sent_start but at any rate he might answer questions how am i to get in she repeated aloud sent_end', 'sent_start i shall sit here the footman remarked till tomorrow at this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate came skimming out straight at the footman s head it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him sent_end', 'sent_start or next day maybe the footman continued in the same tone exactly as if nothing had happened sent_end', 'sent_start how am i to get in asked alice again in a louder tone sent_end', 'sent_start are you to get in at all said the footman sent_end', 'sent_start that s the first question you know it was no doubt only alice did not like to be told so sent_end', 'sent_start it s really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue sent_end', 'sent_start it s enough to drive one crazy the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations sent_end', 'sent_start i shall sit here he said on and off for days and days but what am i to do said alice sent_end', 'sent_start anything you like said the footman and began whistling sent_end', 'sent_start oh there s no use in talking to him said alice desperately he s perfectly idiotic and she opened the door and went in sent_end', 'sent_start the door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the duchess was sitting on a three stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup sent_end', 'sent_start there s certainly too much pepper in that soup alice said to herself as well as she could for sneezing sent_end', 'sent_start there was certainly too much of it in the air sent_end', 'sent_start even the duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment s pause sent_end', 'sent_start the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear sent_end', 'sent_start please would you tell me said alice a little timidly for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first why your cat grins like that it s a cheshire cat said the duchess and that s why sent_end', 'sent_start pig she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on again i didn t know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didn t know that cats could grin they all can said the duchess and most of em do i don t know of any that do alice said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation sent_end', 'sent_start you don t know much said the duchess and that s a fact alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation sent_end', 'sent_start while she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby the fire came first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes sent_end', 'sent_start the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not sent_end', 'sent_start oh please mind what you re doing cried alice jumping up and down in an agony of terror sent_end', 'sent_start oh there goes his precious nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off sent_end', 'sent_start if everybody minded their own business the duchess said in a hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it does which would not be an advantage said alice who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge sent_end', 'sent_start just think of what work it would make with the day and night sent_end', 'sent_start you see the earth takes twenty hours to turn round on its axis talking of axes said the duchess chop off her head alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to be listening so she went on again twenty hours i think or is it twelve sent_end', 'sent_start i oh don t bother me said the duchess i never could abide figures and with that she began nursing her child again singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line speak roughly to your little boy and beat him when he sneezes he only does it to annoy because he knows it teases chorus sent_end', 'sent_start in which the cook and the baby joined wow sent_end', 'sent_start wow sent_end', 'sent_start wow while the duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing howled so that alice could hardly hear the words i speak severely to my boy i beat him when he sneezes for he can thoroughly enjoy the pepper when he pleases chorus sent_end', 'sent_start wow sent_end', 'sent_start wow sent_end', 'sent_start wow here sent_end', 'sent_start you may nurse it a bit if you like the duchess said to alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke sent_end', 'sent_start i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen and she hurried out of the room sent_end', 'sent_start the cook threw a frying after her as she went out but it just missed her sent_end', 'sent_start alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queer little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions just like a star thought alice sent_end', 'sent_start the poor little thing was snorting like a steam when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it sent_end', 'sent_start as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she carried it out into the open air sent_end', 'sent_start if i don t take this child away with me thought alice they re sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn t it be murder to leave it behind she said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time sent_end', 'sent_start don t grunt said alice that s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it sent_end', 'sent_start there could be no doubt that it had a very turn nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all sent_end', 'sent_start but perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears sent_end', 'sent_start no there were no tears sent_end', 'sent_start if you re going to turn into a pig my dear said alice seriously i ll have nothing more to do with you sent_end', 'sent_start mind now the poor little thing sobbed again or grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for some while in silence sent_end', 'sent_start alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm sent_end', 'sent_start this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further sent_end', 'sent_start so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood sent_end', 'sent_start if it had grown up she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig i think and she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off sent_end', 'sent_start the cat only grinned when it saw alice sent_end', 'sent_start it looked good she thought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect sent_end', 'sent_start cheshire puss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider sent_end', 'sent_start come it s pleased so far thought alice and she went on sent_end', 'sent_start would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here that depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the cat sent_end', 'sent_start i don t much care where said alice sent_end', 'sent_start then it doesn t matter which way you go said the cat sent_end', 'sent_start so long as i get somewhere alice added as an explanation sent_end', 'sent_start oh you re sure to do that said the cat if you only walk long enough alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question sent_end', 'sent_start what sort of people live about here in that direction the cat said waving its right paw round lives a hatter and in that direction waving the other paw lives a march hare sent_end', 'sent_start visit either you like they re both mad but i don t want to go among mad people alice remarked sent_end', 'sent_start oh you can t help that said the cat we re all mad here sent_end', 'sent_start i m mad sent_end', 'sent_start you re mad how do you know i m mad said alice sent_end', 'sent_start you must be said the cat or you wouldn t have come here alice didn t think that proved it at all however she went on and how do you know that you re mad to begin with said the cat a dog s not mad sent_end', 'sent_start you grant that i suppose so said alice sent_end', 'sent_start well then the cat went on you see a dog growls when it s angry and wags its tail when it s pleased sent_end', 'sent_start now i growl when i m pleased and wag my tail when i m angry sent_end', 'sent_start therefore i m mad i call it purring not growling said alice sent_end', 'sent_start call it what you like said the cat sent_end', 'sent_start do you play croquet with the queen to i should like it very much said alice but i haven t been invited yet you ll see me there said the cat and vanished sent_end', 'sent_start alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used to queer things happening sent_end', 'sent_start while she was looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared again sent_end', 'sent_start by what became of the baby said the cat sent_end', 'sent_start i d nearly forgotten to ask it turned into a pig alice quietly said just as if it had come back in a natural way sent_end', 'sent_start i thought it would said the cat and vanished again sent_end', 'sent_start alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live sent_end', 'sent_start i ve seen hatters before she said to herself the march hare will be much the most interesting and perhaps as this is may it won t be raving mad at least not so mad as it was in march as she said this she looked up and there was the cat again sitting on a branch of a tree sent_end', 'sent_start did you say pig or fig said the cat sent_end', 'sent_start i said pig replied alice and i wish you wouldn t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy all right said the cat and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone sent_end', 'sent_start well sent_end', 'sent_start i ve often seen a cat without a grin thought alice but a grin without a cat sent_end', 'sent_start it s the most curious thing i ever saw in my life she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare she thought it must be the right house because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur sent_end', 'sent_start it was so large a house that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself suppose it should be raving mad after all sent_end', 'sent_start i almost wish i d gone to see the hatter instead chapter vii sent_end', 'sent_start a mad tea there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head sent_end', 'sent_start very uncomfortable for the dormouse thought alice only as it s asleep i suppose it doesn t mind the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it no room sent_end', 'sent_start no room they cried out when they saw alice coming sent_end', 'sent_start there s plenty of room said alice indignantly and she sat down in a large arm at one end of the table sent_end', 'sent_start have some wine the march hare said in an encouraging tone sent_end', 'sent_start alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea sent_end', 'sent_start i don t see any wine she remarked sent_end', 'sent_start there isn t any said the march hare sent_end', 'sent_start then it wasn t very civil of you to offer it said alice angrily sent_end', 'sent_start it wasn t very civil of you to sit down without being invited said the march hare sent_end', 'sent_start i didn t know it was your table said alice it s laid for a great many more than three your hair wants cutting said the hatter sent_end', 'sent_start he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech sent_end', 'sent_start you should learn not to make personal remarks alice said with some severity it s very rude the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a raven like a writing come we shall have some fun now thought alice sent_end', 'sent_start i m glad they ve begun asking riddles i believe i can guess that she added aloud sent_end', 'sent_start do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the march hare sent_end', 'sent_start exactly so said alice sent_end', 'sent_start then you should say what you mean the march hare went on sent_end', 'sent_start i do alice hastily replied at least at least i mean what i say that s the same thing you know not the same thing a bit said the hatter sent_end', 'sent_start you might just as well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat what i see you might just as well say added the march hare that i like what i get is the same thing as i get what i like you might just as well say added the dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing as i sleep when i breathe it is the same thing with you said the hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing which wasn t much sent_end', 'sent_start the hatter was the first to break the silence sent_end', 'sent_start what day of the month is it he said turning to alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear sent_end', 'sent_start alice considered a little and then said the fourth two days wrong sighed the hatter sent_end', 'sent_start i told you butter wouldn t suit the works he added looking angrily at the march hare sent_end', 'sent_start it was the best butter the march hare meekly replied sent_end', 'sent_start yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hatter grumbled you shouldn t have put it in with the bread the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark it was the best butter you know alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity sent_end', 'sent_start what a funny watch she remarked sent_end', 'sent_start it tells the day of the month and doesn t tell what o clock it is why should it muttered the hatter sent_end', 'sent_start does your watch tell you what year it is of course not alice replied very readily but that s because it stays the same year for such a long time together which is just the case with mine said the hatter sent_end', 'sent_start alice felt dreadfully puzzled sent_end', 'sent_start the hatter s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly english sent_end', 'sent_start i don t quite understand you she said as politely as she could sent_end', 'sent_start the dormouse is asleep again said the hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose sent_end', 'sent_start the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes of course of course just what i was going to remark myself have you guessed the riddle yet the hatter said turning to alice again sent_end', 'sent_start no i give it up alice replied what s the answer i haven t the slightest idea said the hatter sent_end', 'sent_start nor i said the march hare sent_end', 'sent_start alice sighed wearily sent_end', 'sent_start i think you might do something better with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers if you knew time as well as i do said the hatter you wouldn t talk about wasting it sent_end', 'sent_start it s him i don t know what you mean said alice sent_end', 'sent_start of course you don t the hatter said tossing his head contemptuously sent_end', 'sent_start i dare say you never even spoke to time perhaps not alice cautiously replied but i know i have to beat time when i learn music ah sent_end', 'sent_start that accounts for it said the hatter sent_end', 'sent_start he won t stand beating sent_end', 'sent_start now if you only kept on good terms with him he d do almost anything you liked with the clock sent_end', 'sent_start for instance suppose it were nine o clock in the morning just time to begin lessons you d only have to whisper a hint to time and round goes the clock in a twinkling sent_end', 'sent_start half one time for dinner i only wish it was the march hare said to itself in a whisper sent_end', 'sent_start that would be grand certainly said alice thoughtfully but then i shouldn t be hungry for it you know not at first perhaps said the hatter but you could keep it to half one as long as you liked is that the way you manage alice asked sent_end', 'sent_start the hatter shook his head mournfully sent_end', 'sent_start not i he replied sent_end', 'sent_start we quarrelled last march just before he went mad you know pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing twinkle twinkle little bat sent_end', 'sent_start how i wonder what you re at you know the song perhaps i ve heard something like it said alice sent_end', 'sent_start it goes on you know the hatter continued in this way up above the world you fly like a tea in the sky sent_end', 'sent_start twinkle twinkle here the dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop sent_end', 'sent_start well i d hardly finished the first verse said the hatter when the queen jumped up and bawled out he s murdering the time sent_end', 'sent_start off with his head how dreadfully savage exclaimed alice sent_end', 'sent_start and ever since that the hatter went on in a mournful tone he won t do a thing i ask sent_end', 'sent_start it s always six o clock now a bright idea came into alice s head sent_end', 'sent_start is that the reason so many tea are put out here she asked sent_end', 'sent_start yes that s it said the hatter with a sigh it s always tea and we ve no time to wash the things between whiles then you keep moving round i suppose said alice sent_end', 'sent_start exactly so said the hatter as the things get used up but what happens when you come to the beginning again alice ventured to ask sent_end', 'sent_start suppose we change the subject the march hare interrupted yawning sent_end', 'sent_start i m getting tired of this sent_end', 'sent_start i vote the young lady tells us a story i m afraid i don t know one said alice rather alarmed at the proposal sent_end', 'sent_start then the dormouse shall they both cried sent_end', 'sent_start wake up dormouse and they pinched it on both sides at once sent_end', 'sent_start the dormouse slowly opened his eyes sent_end', 'sent_start i wasn t asleep he said in a hoarse feeble voice i heard every word you fellows were saying tell us a story said the march hare sent_end', 'sent_start yes please do pleaded alice sent_end', 'sent_start and be quick about it added the hatter or you ll be asleep again before it s done once upon a time there were three little sisters the dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were elsie lacie and tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well what did they live on said alice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking sent_end', 'sent_start they lived on treacle said the dormouse after thinking a minute or two sent_end', 'sent_start they couldn t have done that you know alice gently remarked they d have been ill so they were said the dormouse very ill alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on but why did they live at the bottom of a well take some more tea the march hare said to alice very earnestly sent_end', 'sent_start i ve had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i can t take more you mean you can t take less said the hatter it s very easy to take more than nothing nobody asked your opinion said alice sent_end', 'sent_start who s making personal remarks now the hatter asked triumphantly sent_end', 'sent_start alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and bread and then turned to the dormouse and repeated her question sent_end', 'sent_start why did they live at the bottom of a well the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said it was a treacle there s no such thing alice was beginning very angrily but the hatter and the march hare went sh sent_end', 'sent_start sh and the dormouse sulkily remarked if you can t be civil you d better finish the story for yourself no please go on alice said very humbly i won t interrupt again sent_end', 'sent_start i dare say there may be one one indeed said the dormouse indignantly sent_end', 'sent_start however he consented to go on sent_end', 'sent_start and so these three little sisters they were learning to draw you know what did they draw said alice quite forgetting her promise sent_end', 'sent_start treacle said the dormouse without considering at all this time sent_end', 'sent_start i want a clean cup interrupted the hatter let s all move one place on he moved on as he spoke and the dormouse followed him the march hare moved into the dormouse s place and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare sent_end', 'sent_start the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change and alice was a good deal worse off than before as the march hare had just upset the milk into his plate sent_end', 'sent_start alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she began very cautiously but i don t understand sent_end', 'sent_start where did they draw the treacle from you can draw water out of a water said the hatter so i should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle eh stupid but they were in the well alice said to the dormouse not choosing to notice this last remark sent_end', 'sent_start of course they were said the dormouse well in this answer so confused poor alice that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it sent_end', 'sent_start they were learning to draw the dormouse went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of things everything that begins with an m why with an m said alice sent_end', 'sent_start why not said the march hare sent_end', 'sent_start alice was silent sent_end', 'sent_start the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on that begins with an m such as mouse and the moon and memory and muchness you know you say things are much of a muchness did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness really now you ask me said alice very much confused i don t think then you shouldn t talk said the hatter sent_end', 'sent_start this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot sent_end', 'sent_start at any rate i ll never go there again said alice as she picked her way through the wood sent_end', 'sent_start it s the stupidest tea i ever was at in all my life just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it sent_end', 'sent_start that s very curious she thought sent_end', 'sent_start but everything s curious today sent_end', 'sent_start i think i may as well go in at once and in she went sent_end', 'sent_start once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table sent_end', 'sent_start now i ll manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden sent_end', 'sent_start then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and then she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flower and the cool fountains sent_end', 'sent_start chapter viii sent_end', 'sent_start the queen s croquet a large rose stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red sent_end', 'sent_start alice thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say look out now five sent_end', 'sent_start don t go splashing paint over me like that i couldn t help it said five in a sulky tone seven jogged my elbow on which seven looked up and said that s right five sent_end', 'sent_start always lay the blame on others you d better not talk said five sent_end', 'sent_start i heard the queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded what for said the one who had spoken first sent_end', 'sent_start that s none of your business two said seven sent_end', 'sent_start yes it is his business said five and i ll tell him it was for bringing the cook tulip instead of onions seven flung down his brush and had just begun well of all the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also and all of them bowed low sent_end', 'sent_start would you tell me said alice a little timidly why you are painting those roses five and seven said nothing but looked at two sent_end', 'sent_start two began in a low voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rose and we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know sent_end', 'sent_start so you see miss we re doing our best afore she comes to at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out the queen sent_end', 'sent_start the queen and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces sent_end', 'sent_start there was a sound of many footsteps and alice looked round eager to see the queen sent_end', 'sent_start first came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did sent_end', 'sent_start after these came the royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts sent_end', 'sent_start next came the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognised the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her sent_end', 'sent_start then followed the knave of hearts carrying the king s crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came the king and queen of hearts sent_end', 'sent_start alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of a procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldn t see it so she stood still where she was and waited sent_end', 'sent_start when the procession came opposite to alice they all stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this she said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply sent_end', 'sent_start idiot said the queen tossing her head impatiently and turning to alice she went on what s your name child my name is alice so please your majesty said alice very politely but she added to herself why they re only a pack of cards after all sent_end', 'sent_start i needn t be afraid of them and who are these said the queen pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own children sent_end', 'sent_start how should i know said alice surprised at her own courage sent_end', 'sent_start it s no business of mine the queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast screamed off with her head sent_end', 'sent_start off nonsense said alice very loudly and decidedly and the queen was silent sent_end', 'sent_start the king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said consider my dear she is only a child the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave turn them over the knave did so very carefully with one foot sent_end', 'sent_start get up said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the king the queen the royal children and everybody else sent_end', 'sent_start leave off that screamed the queen sent_end', 'sent_start you make me giddy and then turning to the rose she went on what have you been doing here may it please your majesty said two in a very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying i see said the queen who had meanwhile been examining the roses sent_end', 'sent_start off with their heads and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran to alice for protection sent_end', 'sent_start you shan t be beheaded said alice and she put them into a large flower that stood near sent_end', 'sent_start the three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the others sent_end', 'sent_start are their heads off shouted the queen sent_end', 'sent_start their heads are gone if it please your majesty the soldiers shouted in reply sent_end', 'sent_start that s right shouted the queen sent_end', 'sent_start can you play croquet the soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the question was evidently meant for her sent_end', 'sent_start yes shouted alice sent_end', 'sent_start come on then roared the queen and alice joined the procession wondering very much what would happen next sent_end', 'sent_start it s it s a very fine day said a timid voice at her side sent_end', 'sent_start she was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face sent_end', 'sent_start very said alice where s the duchess hush sent_end', 'sent_start hush said the rabbit in a low hurried tone sent_end', 'sent_start he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered she s under sentence of execution what for said alice sent_end', 'sent_start did you say what a pity the rabbit asked sent_end', 'sent_start no i didn t said alice i don t think it s at all a pity sent_end', 'sent_start i said what for she boxed the queen s ears the rabbit began sent_end', 'sent_start alice gave a little scream of laughter sent_end', 'sent_start oh hush the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone sent_end', 'sent_start the queen will hear you sent_end', 'sent_start you see she came rather late and the queen said get to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began sent_end', 'sent_start alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arches sent_end', 'sent_start the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubled soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed sent_end', 'sent_start the players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting off with his head or off with her head about once in a minute sent_end', 'sent_start alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then thought she what would become of me sent_end', 'sent_start they re dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that there s any one left alive she was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself it s the cheshire cat now i shall have somebody to talk to how are you getting on said the cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with sent_end', 'sent_start alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded sent_end', 'sent_start it s no use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at least one of them in another minute the whole head appeared and then alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her sent_end', 'sent_start the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared sent_end', 'sent_start i don t think they play at all fairly alice began in rather a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can t hear oneself speak and they don t seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to them and you ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance there s the arch i ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground and i should have croqueted the queen s hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine coming how do you like the queen said the cat in a low voice sent_end', 'sent_start not at all said alice she s so extremely just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her listening so she went on likely to win that it s hardly worth while finishing the game the queen smiled and passed on sent_end', 'sent_start who are you talking to said the king going up to alice and looking at the cat s head with great curiosity sent_end', 'sent_start it s a friend of mine a cheshire cat said alice allow me to introduce it i don t like the look of it at all said the king however it may kiss my hand if it likes i d rather not the cat remarked sent_end', 'sent_start don t be impertinent said the king and don t look at me like that he got behind alice as he spoke sent_end', 'sent_start a cat may look at a king said alice sent_end', 'sent_start i ve read that in some book but i don t remember where well it must be removed said the king very decidedly and he called the queen who was passing at the moment my dear sent_end', 'sent_start i wish you would have this cat removed the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small sent_end', 'sent_start off with his head she said without even looking round sent_end', 'sent_start i ll fetch the executioner myself said the king eagerly and he hurried off sent_end', 'sent_start alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the queen s voice in the distance screaming with passion sent_end', 'sent_start she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not sent_end', 'sent_start so she went in search of her hedgehog sent_end', 'sent_start the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree sent_end', 'sent_start by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesn t matter much thought alice as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground so she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friend sent_end', 'sent_start when she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable sent_end', 'sent_start the moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said sent_end', 'sent_start the executioner s argument was that you couldn t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before and he wasn t going to begin at his time of life sent_end', 'sent_start the king s argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded and that you weren t to talk nonsense sent_end', 'sent_start the queen s argument was that if something wasn t done about it in less than no time she d have everybody executed all round sent_end', 'sent_start it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious sent_end', 'sent_start alice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the duchess you d better ask her about it she s in prison the queen said to the executioner fetch her here and the executioner went off like an arrow sent_end', 'sent_start the cat s head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the duchess it had entirely disappeared so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game sent_end', 'sent_start chapter ix sent_end', 'sent_start the mock turtle s story you can t think how glad i am to see you again you dear old thing said the duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately into alice s and they walked off together sent_end', 'sent_start alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen sent_end', 'sent_start when i m a duchess she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though i won t have any pepper in my kitchen at all sent_end', 'sent_start soup does very well without maybe it s always pepper that makes people hot she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them sour and camomile that makes them bitter and and barley and such things that make children sweet sent_end', 'sent_start i only wish people knew that then they wouldn t be so stingy about it you know she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear sent_end', 'sent_start you re thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk sent_end', 'sent_start i can t tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in a bit perhaps it hasn t one alice ventured to remark sent_end', 'sent_start tut tut child said the duchess sent_end', 'sent_start everything s got a moral if only you can find it and she squeezed herself up closer to alice s side as she spoke sent_end', 'sent_start alice did not much like keeping so close to her first because the duchess was very ugly and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alice s shoulder and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin sent_end', 'sent_start however she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could sent_end', 'sent_start the game s going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up the conversation a little sent_end', 'sent_start tis so said the duchess and the moral of that is oh tis love tis love that makes the world go round somebody said alice whispered that it s done by everybody minding their own business ah well sent_end', 'sent_start it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alice s shoulder as she added and the moral of that is take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves how fond she is of finding morals in things alice thought to herself sent_end', 'sent_start i dare say you re wondering why i don t put my arm round your waist the duchess said after a pause the reason is that i m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo sent_end', 'sent_start shall i try the experiment he might bite alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried sent_end', 'sent_start very true said the duchess flamingoes and mustard both bite sent_end', 'sent_start and the moral of that is birds of a feather flock together only mustard isn t a bird alice remarked sent_end', 'sent_start right as usual said the duchess what a clear way you have of putting things it s a mineral i think said alice sent_end', 'sent_start of course it is said the duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said there s a large mustard near here sent_end', 'sent_start and the moral of that is the more there is of mine the less there is of yours oh i know exclaimed alice who had not attended to this last remark it s a vegetable sent_end', 'sent_start it doesn t look like one but it is i quite agree with you said the duchess and the moral of that is be what you would seem to be or if you d like it put more simply never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise i think i should understand that better alice said very politely if i had it written down but i can t quite follow it as you say it that s nothing to what i could say if i chose the duchess replied in a pleased tone sent_end', 'sent_start pray don t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said alice sent_end', 'sent_start oh don t talk about trouble said the duchess sent_end', 'sent_start i make you a present of everything i ve said as yet a cheap sort of present thought alice sent_end', 'sent_start i m glad they don t give birthday presents like that but she did not venture to say it out loud sent_end', 'sent_start thinking again the duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin sent_end', 'sent_start i ve a right to think said alice sharply for she was beginning to feel a little worried sent_end', 'sent_start just about as much right said the duchess as pigs have to fly and the m but here to alice s great surprise the duchess s voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word moral and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble sent_end', 'sent_start alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm sent_end', 'sent_start a fine day your majesty the duchess began in a low weak voice sent_end', 'sent_start now i give you fair warning shouted the queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time sent_end', 'sent_start take your choice the duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment sent_end', 'sent_start let s go on with the game the queen said to alice and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquet sent_end', 'sent_start the other guests had taken advantage of the queen s absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the queen merely remarking that a moment s delay would cost them their lives sent_end', 'sent_start all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting off with his head or off with her head those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the king the queen and alice were in custody and under sentence of execution sent_end', 'sent_start then the queen left off quite out of breath and said to alice have you seen the mock turtle yet no said alice sent_end', 'sent_start i don t even know what a mock turtle is it s the thing mock turtle soup is made from said the queen sent_end', 'sent_start i never saw one or heard of one said alice sent_end', 'sent_start come on then said the queen and he shall tell you his history as they walked off together alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally you are all pardoned come that s a good thing she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered sent_end', 'sent_start they very soon came upon a gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun sent_end', 'sent_start if you don t know what a gryphon is look at the picture sent_end', 'sent_start up lazy thing said the queen and take this young lady to see the mock turtle and to hear his history sent_end', 'sent_start i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered and she walked off leaving alice alone with the gryphon sent_end', 'sent_start alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage queen so she waited sent_end', 'sent_start the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled sent_end', 'sent_start what fun said the gryphon half to itself half to alice sent_end', 'sent_start what is the fun said alice sent_end', 'sent_start why she said the gryphon sent_end', 'sent_start it s all her fancy that they never executes nobody you know sent_end', 'sent_start come on everybody says come on here thought alice as she went slowly after it i never was so ordered about in all my life never they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break sent_end', 'sent_start she pitied him deeply sent_end', 'sent_start what is his sorrow she asked the gryphon and the gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before it s all his fancy that he hasn t got no sorrow you know sent_end', 'sent_start come on so they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing sent_end', 'sent_start this here young lady said the gryphon she wants for to know your history she do i ll tell it her said the mock turtle in a deep hollow tone sit down both of you and don t speak a word till i ve finished so they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes sent_end', 'sent_start alice thought to herself i don t see how he can even finish if he doesn t begin but she waited patiently sent_end', 'sent_start once said the mock turtle at last with a deep sigh i was a real turtle these words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle sent_end', 'sent_start alice was very nearly getting up and saying thank you sir for your interesting story but she could not help thinking there must be more to come so she sat still and said nothing sent_end', 'sent_start when we were little the mock turtle went on at last more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to school in the sea sent_end', 'sent_start the master was an old turtle we used to call him tortoise why did you call him tortoise if he wasn t one alice asked sent_end', 'sent_start we called him tortoise because he taught us said the mock turtle angrily really you are very dull you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question added the gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth sent_end', 'sent_start at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle drive on old fellow sent_end', 'sent_start don t be all day about it and he went on in these words yes we went to school in the sea though you mayn t believe it i never said i didn t interrupted alice sent_end', 'sent_start you did said the mock turtle sent_end', 'sent_start hold your tongue added the gryphon before alice could speak again sent_end', 'sent_start the mock turtle went on sent_end', 'sent_start we had the best of educations in fact we went to school every day i ve been to a day too said alice you needn t be so proud as all that with extras asked the mock turtle a little anxiously sent_end', 'sent_start yes said alice we learned french and music and washing said the mock turtle sent_end', 'sent_start certainly not said alice indignantly sent_end', 'sent_start ah sent_end', 'sent_start then yours wasn t a really good school said the mock turtle in a tone of great relief sent_end', 'sent_start now at ours they had at the end of the bill french music and washing extra you couldn t have wanted it much said alice living at the bottom of the sea i couldn t afford to learn it said the mock turtle with a sigh sent_end', 'sent_start i only took the regular course what was that inquired alice sent_end', 'sent_start reeling and writhing of course to begin with the mock turtle replied and then the different branches of arithmetic ambition distraction uglification and derision i never heard of uglification alice ventured to say sent_end', 'sent_start what is it the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise sent_end', 'sent_start what sent_end', 'sent_start never heard of uglifying it exclaimed sent_end', 'sent_start you know what to beautify is i suppose yes said alice doubtfully it means to make anything prettier well then the gryphon went on if you don t know what to uglify is you are a simpleton alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she turned to the mock turtle and said what else had you to learn well there was mystery the mock turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers mystery ancient and modern with seaography then drawling the drawling was an old conger that used to come once a week he taught us drawling stretching and fainting in coils what was that like said alice sent_end', 'sent_start well i can t show it you myself the mock turtle said i m too stiff sent_end', 'sent_start and the gryphon never learnt it hadn t time said the gryphon i went to the classics master though sent_end', 'sent_start he was an old crab he was i never went to him the mock turtle said with a sigh he taught laughing and grief they used to say so he did so he did said the gryphon sighing in his turn and both creatures hid their faces in their paws sent_end', 'sent_start and how many hours a day did you do lessons said alice in a hurry to change the subject sent_end', 'sent_start ten hours the first day said the mock turtle nine the next and so on what a curious plan exclaimed alice sent_end', 'sent_start that s the reason they re called lessons the gryphon remarked because they lessen from day to day this was quite a new idea to alice and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark sent_end', 'sent_start then the eleventh day must have been a holiday of course it was said the mock turtle sent_end', 'sent_start and how did you manage on the twelfth alice went on eagerly sent_end', 'sent_start that s enough about lessons the gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone tell her something about the games now chapter x sent_end', 'sent_start the lobster quadrille the mock turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes sent_end', 'sent_start he looked at alice and tried to speak but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice sent_end', 'sent_start same as if he had a bone in his throat said the gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back sent_end', 'sent_start at last the mock turtle recovered his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on again you may not have lived much under the sea i haven t said alice and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster alice began to say i once tasted but checked herself hastily and said no never so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is no indeed said alice sent_end', 'sent_start what sort of a dance is it why said the gryphon you first form into a line along the sea two lines cried the mock turtle sent_end', 'sent_start seals turtles salmon and so on then when you ve cleared all the jelly out of the way that generally takes some time interrupted the gryphon sent_end', 'sent_start you advance twice each with a lobster as a partner cried the gryphon sent_end', 'sent_start of course the mock turtle said advance twice set to partners change lobsters and retire in same order continued the gryphon sent_end', 'sent_start then you know the mock turtle went on you throw the the lobsters shouted the gryphon with a bound into the air sent_end', 'sent_start as far out to sea as you can swim after them screamed the gryphon sent_end', 'sent_start turn a somersault in the sea cried the mock turtle capering wildly about sent_end', 'sent_start change lobsters again yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice sent_end', 'sent_start back to land again and that s all the first figure said the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at alice sent_end', 'sent_start it must be a very pretty dance said alice timidly sent_end', 'sent_start would you like to see a little of it said the mock turtle sent_end', 'sent_start very much indeed said alice sent_end', 'sent_start come let s try the first figure said the mock turtle to the gryphon sent_end', 'sent_start we can do without lobsters you know sent_end', 'sent_start which shall sing oh you sing said the gryphon sent_end', 'sent_start i ve forgotten the words so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while the mock turtle sang this very slowly and sadly will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail sent_end', 'sent_start there s a porpoise close behind us and he s treading on my tail sent_end', 'sent_start see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance sent_end', 'sent_start they are waiting on the shingle will you come and join the dance sent_end', 'sent_start will you won t you will you won t you will you join the dance sent_end', 'sent_start will you won t you will you won t you won t you join the dance sent_end', 'sent_start you can really have no notion how delightful it will be when they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea but the snail replied too far too far and gave a look askance said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance sent_end', 'sent_start would not could not would not could not would not join the dance sent_end', 'sent_start would not could not would not could not could not join the dance sent_end', 'sent_start what matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied sent_end', 'sent_start there is another shore you know upon the other side sent_end', 'sent_start the further off from england the nearer is to france then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance sent_end', 'sent_start will you won t you will you won t you will you join the dance sent_end', 'sent_start will you won t you will you won t you won t you join the dance thank you it s a very interesting dance to watch said alice feeling very glad that it was over at last and i do so like that curious song about the whiting oh as to the whiting said the mock turtle they you ve seen them of course yes said alice i ve often seen them at dinn she checked herself hastily sent_end', 'sent_start i don t know where dinn may be said the mock turtle but if you ve seen them so often of course you know what they re like i believe so alice replied thoughtfully sent_end', 'sent_start they have their tails in their mouths and they re all over crumbs you re wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea sent_end', 'sent_start but they have their tails in their mouths and the reason is here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes tell her about the reason and all that he said to the gryphon sent_end', 'sent_start the reason is said the gryphon that they would go with the lobsters to the dance sent_end', 'sent_start so they got thrown out to sea sent_end', 'sent_start so they had to fall a long way sent_end', 'sent_start so they got their tails fast in their mouths sent_end', 'sent_start so they couldn t get them out again sent_end', 'sent_start that s all thank you said alice it s very interesting sent_end', 'sent_start i never knew so much about a whiting before i can tell you more than that if you like said the gryphon sent_end', 'sent_start do you know why it s called a whiting i never thought about it said alice sent_end', 'sent_start why it does the boots and shoes the gryphon replied very solemnly sent_end', 'sent_start alice was thoroughly puzzled sent_end', 'sent_start does the boots and shoes she repeated in a wondering tone sent_end', 'sent_start why what are your shoes done with said the gryphon sent_end', 'sent_start i mean what makes them so shiny alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her answer sent_end', 'sent_start they re done with blacking i believe boots and shoes under the sea the gryphon went on in a deep voice are done with a whiting sent_end', 'sent_start now you know and what are they made of alice asked in a tone of great curiosity sent_end', 'sent_start soles and eels of course the gryphon replied rather impatiently any shrimp could have told you that if i d been the whiting said alice whose thoughts were still running on the song i d have said to the porpoise keep back please we don t want you with us they were obliged to have him with them the mock turtle said no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise wouldn t it really said alice in a tone of great surprise sent_end', 'sent_start of course not said the mock turtle why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a journey i should say with what porpoise don t you mean purpose said alice sent_end', 'sent_start i mean what i say the mock turtle replied in an offended tone sent_end', 'sent_start and the gryphon added come let s hear some of your adventures i could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning said alice a little timidly but it s no use going back to yesterday because i was a different person then explain all that said the mock turtle sent_end', 'sent_start no no sent_end', 'sent_start the adventures first said the gryphon in an impatient tone explanations take such a dreadful time so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the white rabbit sent_end', 'sent_start she was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide but she gained courage as she went on sent_end', 'sent_start her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating you are old father william to the caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the mock turtle drew a long breath and said that s very curious it s all about as curious as it can be said the gryphon sent_end', 'sent_start it all came different the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully sent_end', 'sent_start i should like to hear her try and repeat something now sent_end', 'sent_start tell her to begin he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice sent_end', 'sent_start stand up and repeat tis the voice of the sluggard said the gryphon sent_end', 'sent_start how the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons thought alice i might as well be at school at once however she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeed tis the voice of the lobster i heard him declare you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes later editions continued as follows when the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark but when the tide rises and sharks are around his voice has a timid and tremulous sound sent_end', 'sent_start that s different from what i used to say when i was a child said the gryphon sent_end', 'sent_start well i never heard it before said the mock turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsense alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again sent_end', 'sent_start i should like to have it explained said the mock turtle sent_end', 'sent_start she can t explain it said the gryphon hastily sent_end', 'sent_start go on with the next verse but about his toes the mock turtle persisted sent_end', 'sent_start how could he turn them out with his nose you know it s the first position in dancing alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject sent_end', 'sent_start go on with the next verse the gryphon repeated impatiently it begins i passed by his garden alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice i passed by his garden and marked with one eye how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie later editions continued as follows the panther took pie and gravy and meat while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat sent_end', 'sent_start when the pie was all finished the owl as a boon was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon while the panther received knife and fork with a growl and concluded the banquet what is the use of repeating all that stuff the mock turtle interrupted if you don t explain it as you go on sent_end', 'sent_start it s by far the most confusing thing i ever heard yes i think you d better leave off said the gryphon and alice was only too glad to do so sent_end', 'sent_start shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille the gryphon went on sent_end', 'sent_start or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song oh a song please if the mock turtle would be so kind alice replied so eagerly that the gryphon said in a rather offended tone hm sent_end', 'sent_start no accounting for tastes sent_end', 'sent_start sing her turtle soup will you old fellow the mock turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing this beautiful soup so rich and green waiting in a hot tureen sent_end', 'sent_start who for such dainties would not stoop sent_end', 'sent_start soup of the evening beautiful soup sent_end', 'sent_start soup of the evening beautiful soup sent_end', 'sent_start beau ootiful soo oop sent_end', 'sent_start beau ootiful soo oop sent_end', 'sent_start soo oop of the e e evening beautiful beautiful soup sent_end', 'sent_start beautiful soup sent_end', 'sent_start who cares for fish game or any other dish sent_end', 'sent_start who would not give all else for two pennyworth only of beautiful soup sent_end', 'sent_start pennyworth only of beautiful soup sent_end', 'sent_start beau ootiful soo oop sent_end', 'sent_start beau ootiful soo oop sent_end', 'sent_start soo oop of the e e evening beautiful beauti ful soup chorus again cried the gryphon and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it when a cry of the trial s beginning was heard in the distance sent_end', 'sent_start come on cried the gryphon and taking alice by the hand it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song sent_end', 'sent_start what trial is it alice panted as she ran but the gryphon only answered come on and ran the faster while more and more faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the melancholy words soo oop of the e e evening beautiful beautiful soup chapter xi sent_end', 'sent_start who stole the tarts sent_end', 'sent_start the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other sent_end', 'sent_start in the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made alice quite hungry to look at them i wish they d get the trial done she thought and hand round the refreshments but there seemed to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about her to pass away the time sent_end', 'sent_start alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there sent_end', 'sent_start that s the judge she said to herself because of his great wig the judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crown over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming sent_end', 'sent_start and that s the jury thought alice and those twelve creatures she was obliged to say creatures

meaning in it the jury all wrote down on their slates she doesn t believe there s an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to explain the paper sent_end', 'sent_start if there s no meaning in it said the king that saves a world of trouble you know as we needn t try to find any sent_end', 'sent_start and yet i don t know he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye i seem to see some meaning in them after all sent_end', 'sent_start said i could not swim you can t swim can you he added turning to the knave sent_end', 'sent_start the knave shook his head sadly sent_end', 'sent_start do i look like it he said sent_end', 'sent_start which he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard sent_end', 'sent_start all right so far said the king and

gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face sent_end', 'sent_start wake up alice dear said her sister why what a long sleep you ve had oh i ve had such a curious dream said alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea it s getting late so alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been sent_end', 'sent_start but her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream first she dreamed of little alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers she could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes and still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister s dream sent_end', 'sent_start the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their never meal and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution once more the pig was sneezing on the duchess s knee while plates and dishes crashed around it once more the shriek of the gryphon the squeaking of the lizard s slate and the choking of the suppressed guinea filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle sent_end', 'sent_start so she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull reality the grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep and the queen s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy and the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon and all the other queer noises would change she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farm while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtle s heavy sobs sent_end', 'sent_start lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the after be herself a grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with
